In this assignment, I used the UI mockup as a guide to build this app, and the assets provided in the Google Drive folder. 

I decided to break my app into parts(folders) so when errors occur I will be able to easily detect and rectify them.
## Components 
### Footer
This contains the home, my cards, statistics and settings icons to let the user open those pages if needed. but in this project, it allows the user to view the homepage and settings page.


## Homepage 
### Header.js
This holds the profile details of the user as well as the search icon.
### Card.js
This displays the mastercard image provided in the assets folder of the Google Drive.
### Options.js
This displays the loan, send, receive and top up options.
### Transactions.js
This displays a list of transactions as well as an option to sell all.
### HomePage.js
This collectively wraps every thing else in this folder and displays how the homepage actually looks like.

## Settings 
### Settings.js
This displays the settings page

## Themes 
### Themes.js
This file is where I determined the color scheme of both the light theme and dark theme. 
### ThemeContext.js
